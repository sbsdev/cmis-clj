# cmis-clj

A quick hack to export documents from a content store via
[CMIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_Interoperability_Services).

## Usage

Start a REPL and use it from there.

``` shell
(with-open [writer (io/writer "export/ebooks.csv")]
  (write-ebook-numbers writer (extract-ebook-numbers user password)))

(extract-content user password)
```

You might want to adapt the default values that are hard coded at the
top of `core.clj`.
